# laravel ui livewire
This is based of the [TALL](https://github.com/laravel-frontend-presets/tall) Stack example. I just replaced [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) and 
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [Bootstrap 5](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/).

## Installation
```
composer require haq/laravelui-livewire
php artisan ui livewire
npm install
npm run dev
```
